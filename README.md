# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction


# Objective:

The Restaurant Rating Prediction is a machine learning-based model which will help us to predict the rating of the restaurant in Bangalore. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurants which will help in finding the overall rating for the place.

The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Zomato Dataset and 
build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features.
